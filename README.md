This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.3.5.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Then open your browser at `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload whenever you modify any source files.

## Code scaffolding

To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of schematics (components, directives, pipes, etc.), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project:

```bash
ng build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build is optimized for performance.

## Running tests

To execute unit tests with [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io):

```bash
ng test
```

## End-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not include an e2e framework by default â€” choose one as needed.
